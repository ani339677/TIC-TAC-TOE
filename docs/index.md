# The GAME

I guess, everyone might have played the game Noughts & Crosses, a traditional time-pass game! It is a two-player game, in which one chooses nought(0) and the other, cross(X) and each of them try to fill any one row or column or diagonal with the symbol he or she chooses. And the one who is able to do that wins the game!  
  
Let there be two players, Player1 and Player2. Let Player1 chooses nought(0) and Player2 chooses cross(X) and it's mutually decided that Player1 starts the game, without quarrelling with each other!  
And the game goes on like this,

```
So, finally at the last, **Player2** is winner! Let us congratulate him for his achievement and let's celebrate! But wait, whether his achievement is so big to celebrate? Whether he has defeated the world's best player in this game? Whether Player1 was the best player in this world of this game?  
The answer to all these questions is **NO**!  
  
Let's move on to the best player of this game!
